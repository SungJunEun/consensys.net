## Key Features

-  ### Navbar scroll interaction
    - add `scroll` event listner function to window object 
    - Using `scrollY` API, if `scrollY` is false, make the background transparent, and if not, make it colored.

## Limitation
### What I missed
The first great plan to cloning this website was literally cloning everything; all of interaction, animation, and responsive display. However, As I make, it was kind of impossible for me to do it. As you see, I only attached the desktop version of my website, because it's not responsive enough for mobile, etc. Also, I was unable to implement many different interactions that was in the reference website except what I stated above.
### Why did I missed
The key reason why I failed my initial plan is that it was the biggest size of code that I've made in my own. It's embarrassing but, I was not expecting these size of code and I was overwhelmed enough by doing HTML & basic CSS. 

Another reason was that my code structure was not well structured that it was quite stressful to add or modify the elements after the inital markup of HTML & CSS was over.
